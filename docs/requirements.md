# Objective
Design and implement a complete data management pipeline for a recommendation system. This pipeline should support data ingestion, validation, preparation, transformation, feature management, model training, and orchestration — aligned with the practices of modern data stacks and ML workflows.

## Business Context
Online recommendation systems are fundamental to modern digital platforms such as e-commerce sites, OTT services, and music streaming applications. They personalize user experiences, improve engagement, and drive sales conversions.

Your client — RecoMart, an e-commerce startup — wants to build a data-driven recommendation engine to enhance customer engagement and cross-selling opportunities. The platform collects user behavior data from multiple sources:
    • Web and mobile clickstream logs
    • Transactional purchase history
    • Product metadata from catalogs
    • External APIs (e.g., sentiment or popularity scores)
RecoMart expects a scalable and maintainable data management pipeline to continuously process incoming data, curate features, and train/update models for generating personalized recommendations.

## Scenario
As a Data Engineer in RecoMart’s Data Platform Team, you are tasked to design and implement an automated, modular data pipeline supporting both batch and near-real-time ingestion. The goal is to ensure that the recommendation model always learns from fresh, validated, and well-structured data.

## 1. Problem Formulation
• Define the business problem clearly (e.g., product recommendation to improve conversion rate).
• Identify the key data sources and their attributes (e.g., users, items, ratings, transactions).
• Define the expected outputs from the pipeline:
    ◦ Clean datasets for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    ◦ Engineered features for collaborative/content-based models
    ◦ Deployable recommendation model and inference interface
• Specify evaluation metrics (e.g., Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG).
### Deliverables:
• A short report (PDF) outlining problem definition, objectives, data sources, and expected pipeline outcomes.

## 2. Data Collection and Ingestion

• Ingest at least two types of data (e.g., user interactions from CSV files and product data from REST APIs).
• Design ingestion scripts ensuring:
    ◦ Automated and periodic data fetching
    ◦ Error handling and retry mechanisms
    ◦ Logging for monitoring and audit trails

### Deliverables

• Python scripts for ingestion
• Logs showing ingestion success/failure
• Folder/bucket structure for raw data


## 3. Raw Data Storage

• Store ingested data in a local data lake or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3 or local filesystem).
• Use a structured folder layout partitioned by source, type, and timestamp.

### Deliverables

• Storage structure documentation
• Upload scripts or configuration files

## 4.Data Profiling and Validation

• Apply validation checks to ensure data quality and completeness:
    ◦ Missing values, duplicate entries, schema mismatch
    ◦ Range and format checks (e.g., rating scale 1–5)
• Generate a data quality report summarizing key metrics and issues.
### Deliverables:
• Python code for automated validation (using pandas, great_expectations, or pydeequ)
• Data Quality Report (PDF)

## 5. Data Preparation
• Perform data cleaning and preprocessing:
    ◦ Handle missing user-item interactions
    ◦ Encode categorical attributes (e.g., product categories, user demographics)
    ◦ Normalize numerical variables (e.g., prices, timestamps)
• Conduct exploratory analysis showing interaction distributions, item popularity, and sparsity patterns.
### Deliverables:
• Jupyter notebook or script demonstrating cleaning and EDA
• Summary plots (histograms, heatmaps)
• Prepared dataset ready for transformation

## 6. Feature Engineering and Transformation
• Create features suitable for recommendation algorithms, such as:
    ◦ User activity frequency
    ◦ Average rating per user/item
    ◦ Co-occurrence or similarity-based features
• Store transformed data in a structured database or warehouse.
### Deliverables:
• SQL schema 
• Transformation scripts
• Summary of feature logic

## 7. Feature Store
• Implement a simple feature store (using Feast or a custom metadata registry).
• Document feature names, sources, and transformations.
• Enable versioned retrieval for both training and inference.
### Deliverables:
• Feature store configuration/code
• Feature metadata documentation
• Sample feature retrieval demonstration

## 8. Data Versioning and Lineage
• Use tools like DVC or Git LFS to version raw and transformed data.
• Track metadata such as data source, date of ingestion, and applied transformations.
### Deliverables:
• Repository structure showing dataset versions
• Documentation of versioning workflow

## 9. Model Training and Evaluation
• Train at least one recommendation model:
    ◦ Collaborative filtering (Matrix Factorization / SVD)
    ◦ Content-based filtering
• Evaluate model using metrics.
• Store model metadata using MLflow or an equivalent tracking tool.
### Deliverables:
• Training and evaluation script
• Model performance report
• Tracked model metadata (run IDs, parameters, metrics)

## 10. Pipeline Orchestration
• Automate the end-to-end data pipeline using Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster.
• Define DAGs for data ingestion → validation → preparation → transformation → feature store → model training.
• Include logging and monitoring for failures.
### Deliverables:
• Orchestration DAG/code
• Screenshots or logs from the orchestration tool showing successful execution
